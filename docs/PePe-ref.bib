  abstract = {The key intent of this work is to present a comprehensive comparative literature survey of the state-of-art in software agent-based computing technology and its incorporation within the modelling and simulation domain. The original contribution of this survey is two-fold: (1) Present a concise characterization of almost the entire spectrum of agent-based modelling and simulation tools, thereby highlighting the salient features, merits, and shortcomings of such multi-faceted application software; this article covers eighty five agent-based toolkits that may assist the system designers and developers with common tasks, such as constructing agent-based models and portraying the real-time simulation outputs in tabular/graphical formats and visual recordings. (2) Provide a usable reference that aids engineers, researchers, learners and academicians in readily selecting an appropriate agent-based modelling and simulation toolkit for designing and developing their system models and prototypes, cognizant of both their expertise and those requirements of their application domain. In a nutshell, a significant synthesis of Agent Based Modelling and Simulation (ABMS) resources has been performed in this review that stimulates further investigation into this topic.},

  abstract = {Humanity is facing many grand challenges at unprecedented rates, nearly everywhere, and at all levels. Yet virtually all these challenges can be traced back to the decision and behavior of autonomous agents that constitute the complex systems under such challenges. Agent-based modeling has been developed and employed to address such challenges for a few decades with great achievements and caveats. This article reviews the advances of ABM in social, ecological, and socio-ecological systems, compare ABM with other traditional, equation-based models, provide guidelines for ABM novice, modelers, and reviewers, and point out the challenges and impending tasks that need to be addressed for the ABM community. We further point out great opportunities arising from new forms of data, data science and artificial intelligence, showing that agent behavioral rules can be derived through data mining and machine learning. Towards the end, we call for a new science of Agent-based Complex Systems (ACS) that can pave an effective way to tackle the grand challenges.},

  abstract = {Avoiding the `tragedy of the commons' remains a challenge in many natural resource systems, and open-access fisheries are well-studied in this context. Here, an agent-based model is used to investigate how variation in fisher goals change what policies best solve the tragedy. When fishers' goals are easily satisfied, commons problems are avoided without management interventions, but the imposition of quota limits triggers the tragedy. Thus, commons problems are not necessarily inevitable and sophisticated governance institutions or regulations are not always required to manage them; the same policy may prevent the tragedy or trigger it, depending on the fisher's goals. Given that it is difficult to ascertain them, by using a simulation model we can find patterns that help us identify fishers' goals and incorporate these patterns within our management procedure. This can assist adaptive management to better incorporate behaviour into policy evaluation.}

  author = {Becu, Nicolas and {Frascaria-Lacoste}, Nathalie and Latune, Julie},
  abstract = {This paper presents a novel way to conceptualize and implement roles in computer-assisted participatory simulation. In distributed asymmetric simulation, attention is paid to how tasks, information and perception of the environment are distributed among the different roles of the simulation. The innovation lies in the fact that we use the concept of Habitus defined by Bourdieu to guide us when distributing features to roles. It implies to define for each role a specific simulation environment (visualization, access to information, possible actions) that fits his objective and forces the participant to follow particular action rationales towards the environment. This results in a type of participatory simulation that amplifies the effect of decentering (change of perspective) experienced by participants of a session. It encourages them to deal with plural perspectives and a diversity of representations of the same system. The concept was tested and implemented in an application called NewDistrict. This participatory simulation tool is addressed to an audience concerned by urban development projects and aims to facilitate collective learning on the effects of peri-urbanization on biodiversity. Preliminary results show that it fosters awareness and understanding about differences between the action rationales of roles towards the environment. Considering how distant stakeholders' perceptions may be regarding environmental management, we think that distributed asymmetric simulation is especially well suited to applications in the domain of Human-Nature relationship.},

Government permission for smallholder farmers to extract and sell resin from a pine savanna biosphere-reserve in Mexico has settled a long dispute among different stakeholders in the short-term; however, forest production and conservation beyond 20 years are compromised due to low pine recruitment caused by competition with exotic grasses. Grass control practiced by farmers through grazing and fire has previously been discouraged by conservation authorities, which inadvertently limits long-term pine conservation and use. We describe the participatory design, rationale and simulation attributes of an educational, interactive, agent-based model that explores suites of management options and their economic and ecological outputs. We present and analyze the outcomes of four simulation workshops, where farmers and external-actors better grasped the complex ecological interactions involved in conserving and using pines in grazed pine savanna with exotic grasses, and discussed these findings with a long-term vision and tradeoff analysis approach.},

By reviewing landings records, historical literature, and the local ecological knowledge of fishers, we documented historical practices, uses, and changes in the abundance and distribution of the goliath grouper in these regions. In both the Mexican Caribbean and Campeche Bank, goliath grouper populations were notably impacted by commercial fishing activities in the 1970s and 1980s. The catches during this period could only be sustained for a few years, after which the fishery collapsed. Our results from Campeche Bank indicate that populations persist in an area currently occupied by oil platforms. In the Mexican Caribbean, the extirpation of the goliath grouper may be close at hand, with local exceptions like that of Chetumal Bay. The results of our study indicate that the local goliath grouper populations are in critical danger of extinction, which must be taken into account during the next IUCN Red List regional assessment. In addition, the goliath grouper should be included in the Mexican list for endangered species (NOM-059-SEMARNAT).},

At low fishing pressure, the stochast-random mode yielded a high average catch per boat while sustaining fish biomass. At high fishing pressure, the Cartesian mode was more effective. For the Cartesian strategy, fish biomass exhibited four distinct behaviors with increasing number of boats. In the first phase, the fish biomass dropped with increasing number of boats due to a corresponding rise in biomass extraction. Rapid exploitation occurred in the second phase, when two or more boats occupied the same initial area, that led to the faster abandonment of those sites which then underwent biomass recovery. In the third phase, adding more boats resulted in a fluctuating stock biomass, where the combined effects of initial spatial distribution of boats and rapid localization led to either full stock recovery when boats were eventually confined to a single location due to spillovers, or stock extirpation when the entire area became fully occupied. Beyond the third phase, stock extirpation was assured. In order to break the pattern of localization (bandwagon effect), we introduced stochast-random intruders in a Cartesian-dominated fishery. Adding a single intruder changed the patchy-structured stock biomass pattern of a purely Cartesian fishery to a uniformly explored stock biomass pattern because of the additional spatial information provided by the intruder. Consequently, the average catch per boat increased but at the expense of a disproportionate decline in equilibrium biomass.},

We found that observed vessel behaviour was best predicted in the model by simple decision algorithms whereby vessels chose between exploring new fishing grounds and revisiting previous ones based on their and other vessels' past successes. In contrast, when the model assumed that vessels were perfect profit maximizers, the model substantially overestimated their profits and utilization of quota of rare, constraining species that carry high quota costs, such as yelloweye rockfish. Our results suggest that bounded rationality is an important driver of vessel behaviour in this fishery.},

  abstract = {All basic processes of ecological populations involve decisions; when and where to move, when and what to eat, and whether to fight or flee. Yet decisions and the underlying principles of decision-making have been difficult to integrate into the classical population-level models of ecology. Certainly, there is a long history of modeling individuals' searching behavior, diet selection, or conflict dynamics within social interactions. When all the individuals are given certain simple rules to govern their decision-making processes, the resultant population--level models have yielded important generalizations and theory. But it is also recognized that such models do not represent the way real individuals decide on actions. Factors that influence a decision include the organism's environment with its dynamic rewards and risks, the complex internal state of the organism, and its imperfect knowledge of the environment. In the case of animals, it may also involve complex social factors, and experience and learning, which vary among individuals. The way that all factors are weighed and processed to lead to decisions is a major area of behavioral theory.While classic population-level modeling is limited in its ability to integrate decision-making in its actual complexity, the development of individual- or agent-based models (IBM/ABMs) (we use ABM throughout to designate both ``agent-based modeling'' and an ``agent-based model'') has opened the possibility of describing the way that decisions are made, and their effects, in minute detail. Over the years, these models have increased in size and complexity. Current ABMs can simulate thousands of individuals in realistic environments, and with highly detailed internal physiology, perception and ability to process the perceptions and make decisions based on those and their internal states. The implementation of decision-making in ABMs ranges from fairly simple to highly complex; the process of an individual deciding on an action can occur through the use of logical and simple (if-then) rules to more sophisticated neural networks and genetic algorithms. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the ways in which decisions are integrated into a variety of ABMs and to give a prospectus on the future of modeling of decisions in ABMs.},

While foresters are often invited ``not to put all their eggs in one basket,'' adaptation strategies to climate change mostly depend on silvicultural diversification. To explore how socioeconomic adaptive tools can complement these technical evolutions in forestry, we designed an interdis\- ciplinary and participatory simulation of forest management combining a role-playing game, ecological models of forest evolution, and a severe climate change scenario. Participants from French natural parks and forest organizations responded positively to its multiple applications. Here, we investigate the technical and timberfocused framing of climate change by forest managers. We also analyze participants' negotiations when attempting to change the simulation rules of forest management. Drawing on this experience, we highlight how establishing a payment system for ecosystem services can reduce financial imbalance driven by climate change.},

Human actors play a pivotal role in SESs, but their interactions with each other and their environment are often underrepresented in SES modelling. We argue that more attention should be given to social aspects in models of SESs, but this entails additional kinds of complexity. Modelling choices need to be as transparent as possible, and to be based on analysis of the purposes and limitations of modelling. We recommend thinking in terms of modelling projects rather than single models. Such a project may involve multiple models adopting different modelling methods. We argue that agent-based models (ABMs) are an essential tool in an SES modelling project, but their expressivity, which is their major advantage, also produces problems with model transparency and validation. We propose the use of formal ontologies to make the structure and meaning of models as explicit as possible, facilitating model design, implementation, assessment, comparison and extension.},

The primary objectives of ODD are to make model descriptions more understandable and complete, thereby making ABMs less subject to criticism for being irreproducible. We have systematically evaluated existing uses of the ODD protocol and identified, as expected, parts of ODD needing improvement and clarification. Accordingly, we revise the definition of ODD to clarify aspects of the original version and thereby facilitate future standardization of ABM descriptions. We discuss frequently raised critiques in ODD but also two emerging, and unanticipated, benefits: ODD improves the rigorous formulation of models and helps make the theoretical foundations of large models more visible. Although the protocol was designed for ABMs, it can help with documenting any large, complex model, alleviating some general objections against such models.},

Agent-based models (ABMs) can help to reduce these uncertainties by making it possible to model and simulate human behavior. To understand how ABMs can be applied in fisheries science, a classification scheme was developed based on reviews in other social-ecological domains, theoretical frameworks, and documentation standards. This classification scheme was subsequently used to review agent-based simulation studies that modeled human decision-making in a fisheries context to identify trends and knowledge gaps. Applying the classification scheme revealed that the existing fisheries-related ABMs employ a variety of decision theories, policies, social interactions, agent memories, and data sources, and revealed a wide potential for applications of ABMs to a broad range of research questions and management recommendations. Nevertheless, it turned out that it is, so far, virtually unexplored how environmental factors influence fishing decisions or how social norms and learning influence fishing behavior. It also became clear that the documentation and provenance information of ABMs need to be improved -- e.g., by applying standardized documentation procedures, such as ODD\,+\,D and TRACE -- to enhance the credibility, transparency, and reusability of ABMs in fisheries science.},

Stakeholder engagement in MSP is complex because of the great number and diversity of maritime stakeholders and the unfamiliarity of some of these stakeholders with MSP and its potential impact. To facilitate stakeholder engagement in MSP, the `MSP Challenge' table top strategy game was designed and played as part of several stakeholder events in different European countries. The authors study the efficacy of the game for stakeholder engagement. Background and evaluation data of nineteen game sessions with a total of 310 stakeholders with different backgrounds were collected through post-game surveys. Furthermore, the efficacy of the game for stakeholder engagement processes, organised by competent MSP authorities in Scotland and Belgium, is studied in more detail. The results show that the board game, overall, has been a very efficient and effective way of familiarising a great diversity of stakeholders with MSP and to create meaningful interaction and learning among stakeholders in formal planning processes. However, the case studies also show that contextual factors---the level of familiarity with MSP and participants' perception to sustainability---influences the efficacy of the game.},

The governance system, which minimises conflicts through maximizing agreements, offers an opportunity to achieve a balance between sectoral agendas. Establishing effective governance is challenging in the Southern Gulf of Mexico, where the new Energetic Reform (2013) has stressed the historically fragile equilibrium between fisheries and the oil industry. Through a Social Network Analysis (SNA), this work aims to identify the governance network directly involved in the decision-making process over the fishing-oil SocioEcological System (FOSES) of the coast of Tabasco. The mapping of 53 key actors (classified in eight functional groups) shows that the cohesion between them is low compared to the number of maximum relationships that could be established in the network. The distribution of the actors can be appreciated in three governance agendas. The energy agenda is ruled by the state oil company (PEMEX) and the Mexican Navy, while the socialfishing and intermediary environmental agendas are dominated by the fishing sector and the state environmental protection agency, respectively.},

  abstract = {Governing human-environmental ecosystems is a complex problem. Rule-based fisheries models are faced with several challenges. First, for large geographical problems like oceans, they require considerable time to find satisfactory solutions. Second, they tend to be reactive rather than anticipatory. Behavioural assumptions directly impact fishers' capacity for adaptation and behaviour, which influences possible management strategies. To capture style and speed of adaptation to changes in the environment, coupled human-environment models must progress toward cognitively and socio-culturally realistic representations of fisher decision-making. In this paper, we implement the erotetic decision-making model in the POSEIDON fisheries model. The agents replicate observed behaviours such as fishing the line of a Marine Protected Area, using Individually Tradable Quotas, and returning to favoured fishing locations, and learning to break rules given harsh constraints. This provides a principled proof that reasons-based cognitive structures allow for anticipatory behavioural adaptation rather than reactive behavioural adaptation.},

A primary challenge is, thus, to explain these shifts in terms of the actors and processes operating within a variety of land systems in order to understand how land users might respond locally to future changes in broader-scale environmental and economic conditions. Using `induced intensification' theory as a benchmark, we develop a generalized agent-based model to investigate mechanistic explanations of relationships between agricultural intensity and population density, environmental suitability, and market influence. Land-use and livelihood decisions modeled from basic micro-economic theories generated spatial and temporal patterns of agricultural intensification consistent with predictions of induced intensification theory. Further, agent actions in response to conditions beyond those described by induced intensification theory were explored, revealing that interactions among environmental constraints, population pressure, and market influence may produce transitions to multiple livelihood regimes of varying market integration. The result is new hypotheses that could modify and enrich understanding of the classic relationship between agricultural intensity and population density. The strength of this agent-based model and the experimental results is the generalized form of the decision-making processes underlying land-use and livelihood transitions, creating the prospect of a virtual laboratory for systematically generating hypotheses of how agent decisions and interactions relate to observed land-use and livelihood patterns across diverse land systems.},

The agent-based model simulates the impacts of reedbed management resulting from decisions made by farmers, reed harvesters, hunters, and naturalists. The model is based on an archetypal wetland made of a virtual landscape. Different water regimes are proposed, each one adapted to a particular wetland use. Land-use and water-management decisions are made by the players at both estate and management-unit levels. These decisions are entered into the model each year as the results of the negotiation process between the players. This RPG is designed to promote student awareness of (a) biological and hydrological interdependencies and their dynamics on different spatial and temporal scales, (b) the technical and socioeconomic factors involved in the different types of reedbed use, and (c) the usefulness of the negotiation process for establishing collective management rules. It is shown that BUTORSTAR creates a continuum of learning that crosses the traditional boundaries between disciplines and allows players to conduct multipurpose experiments that contribute to their comprehensive understanding of socioecosystems.},

However, the rationale for choosing a particular human decision model is often not sufficiently empirically or theoretically substantiated in the model documentation.

Therefore, we expand and refine the `ODD' (Overview, Design Concepts and Details) protocol to establish a standard for describing ABMs that includes human decision-making (ODD {\th} D). Because the ODD protocol originates mainly from an ecological perspective, some adaptations are necessary to better capture human decision-making. We extended and rearranged the design concepts and related guiding questions to differentiate and describe decision-making, adaptation and learning of the agents in a comprehensive and clearly structured way. The ODD {\th} D protocol also incorporates a section on `Theoretical and Empirical Background' to encourage model designs and model assumptions that are more closely related to theory. The application of the ODD {\th} D protocol is illustrated with a description of a socialeecological ABM on water use. Although the ODD {\th} D protocol was developed on the basis of example implementations within the socio-ecological scientific community, we believe that the ODD {\th} D protocol may prove helpful for describing ABMs in general when human decisions are included.},

  abstract = {Rules were established in the shallower waters of Tabasco to prevent fishing close to oil platforms ships. The article analyzes the perception of exclusion on the part of fishermen with respect to the petrolization of their marine space. Three workshops were carried out in order to obtain the fishermen's view; participatory mapping was employed to get an understanding of their fishing areas and of oil activities, as well as of the tensions between them and the ``others''. Spatial injustice is evident in the active exclusion of fishermen from the space surrounding oil platforms, as well as in the passive exclusion due to contamination, insecurity, and even more, bleak perspectives for the future. The article shows that these exclusions began with an acceptable arrangement for the inclusion of fishermen, which, nevertheless, led to their exclusion in order to increase extraction, given the exhaustion of Mexico's public oil extraction system.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of fishing effort plays a key role in predicting the impacts of regulatory measures on fisheries. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of bio-economic models to represent and analyze the short-term dynamics of fishing effort in response to regulation in the fisheries management literature. In this literature, fishing firms are usually modeled as autonomous decision-making units determining their harvest strategies so as to maximize profit, given technical and institutional constraints. The overall dynamics of a fishery is modeled as the result of these individual choices, and of interactions between individual choices due to the impacts of harvesting on the fish stock and/or problems of congestion. Applications have, for example, been related to the discussion of closed areas as fisheries management tools. A multi-agent model of a fishery targeting different species in different areas was developed to analyze the implications of taking into account the response of fishing fleets to such regulatory controls. The model is based on the Cormas platform developed for the simulation of the dynamics of common resource systems. An advantage of the multi-agent approach is that it allows a greater degree of complexity than standard bio-economic modeling tools, by focusing on local, rather than global, interactions. Simulation results are presented to illustrate how the model can be used to analyze the consequences of regulatory measures such as temporary fishing bans on the allocation of fishing effort between target species and areas, and the ensuing economic impacts of these measures.},

  abstract = {Despite improved knowledge and stricter regulations, numerous fish stocks remain overharvested. Previous research has shown that fisheries management may fail when the models and assessments used to inform management are based on unrealistic assumptions regarding fishers' decision-making and responses to policies. Improving the understanding of fisher behaviour requires addressing its diversity and complexity through the integration of social science knowledge into modelling. In our paper, we review and synthesize state-of-the-art research on both social science's understanding of fisher behaviour and the representation of fisher decision-making in scientific models. We then develop and experiment with an agent-based social--ecological fisheries model that formalizes three different fishing styles. Thereby we reflect on the implications of our incorporation of behavioural diversity and contrast it with the predominant assumption in fishery models: fishing practices being driven by rational profit maximizing. We envision a next generation of fisheries models and management that account for social scientific knowledge on individual and collective human behaviours. Through our agent-based model, we demonstrate how such an integration is possible and propose a scientific approach for reducing uncertainty based on human behavioural diversity in fisheries. This study serves to lay the foundations for a next generation of social--ecological fishery models that account for human behavioural diversity and social and ecological complexity that are relevant for a realistic assessment and management of fishery sustainability problems.},

  abstract = {Don Hoi Lord, a coastal wetland in the upper gulf of Thailand, is famous for the razor clam (Solen regularis), which is a source of food and income for local fishermen. However, the razor clam population is significantly decreasing so the aim of this study was to analyze the razor clam fishery and develop a management plan engaging the different stakeholders in collective discussions. A participatory modelling approach was used, including (a) agent-based modelling (ABM) and (b) role-playing games (RPG). First, an individual-state distribution model of the razor clam population was designed and calibrated to synthesise knowledge. Two RPG sessions supported by this biological model were organised to initiate collective learning and promote discussion among stakeholders. After playing with the baseline scenario showing the actual harvesting situation, discussions led to the definition of alternative scenarios for clam management such as establishment and rotation of zones closed for harvesting, and quota systems. These scenarios developed during the RPG sessions were more deeply investigated with an agent-based model that included fishermen agents and the individual-state distribution model of the razor clam population. Simulations of different scenarios (reserve, quota and combination of reserve and quota) were produced to enable better informed discussion between different stakeholders. Stakeholders have acknowledged that management through rotating reserves is not efficient if the duration of reserves is too short. They have realised that the efficiency of reserves is hard to assess without better data on clam recruitment. They have also explored another management option which is the quota system. In the final stage, the local participatory process was endorsed by the incumbent regional policy-making actor. Unfortunately, because of rapid administrative rotation the project abruptly lost support. This unexpected event emphasises the need for continuous monitoring of all actors entering and/or leaving the system, which can radically change the interactions among them and, therefore, the whole management context.},
